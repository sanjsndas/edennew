    <h1>Cookies Policy</h1>
    <p>
      At Eden Drift Gardening, we understand the importance of your privacy and recognize the need to be transparent about how we collect and use information through cookies and similar technologies. This Cookies Policy explains what cookies are, how we use them, the types of cookies we use, and your choices regarding cookies when you visit our website. We are committed to helping you understand and manage your privacy preferences effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are small text files stored on your device by websites you visit. They enable the website to remember your actions and preferences over time – like login details or language settings – so you don’t have to re-enter them each time you browse. Cookies can also help website owners analyze their users’ behavior, which aids in improving website performance and usability. While most cookies are harmless and do not personally identify users, they play a significant role in enhancing your online experience.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      We use cookies to improve your browsing experience, provide personalized content, and analyze website traffic. Cookies help us remember your preferences, display customized offers and content, and ensure the website functions optimally. Analytics cookies allow us to understand user interactions and identify areas for enhancement. Some cookies are essential for security, enabling us to safeguard your data and our website against cyber threats.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
    <p>
      Our website uses several types of cookies including essential cookies necessary for site operation, performance cookies that monitor site performance and usage, functional cookies that enhance website features, and targeting cookies used for advertising. Essential cookies enable basic features like page navigation. Performance cookies help us analyze traffic anonymously. Functional cookies store your settings. Targeting cookies may track your browsing habits to show relevant advertisements.
    </p>

    <h2>4. First-Party and Third-Party Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      First-party cookies are set directly by our website and are used for your convenience and security. Third-party cookies may be set by external services integrated into our website, such as analytics or advertising providers. We review these third-party services to ensure they comply with privacy regulations and protect your data. You should be aware that we have limited control over third-party cookies beyond these compliance checks.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Managing Cookie Preferences</h2>
    <p>
      You have control over cookies and can set your browser to refuse or delete cookies. Most browsers allow you to block all cookies, block third-party cookies, or receive notifications about cookie activity. Disabling certain cookies may impact website functionality or your overall browsing experience. Our cookie consent dialog allows you to accept or decline non-essential cookies to customize your preferences easily.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Essential Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Essential cookies are critical for our website to function properly. They enable features like secure login, shopping carts, and page navigation. Without these cookies, certain parts of the site may not work or may behave unpredictably. These cookies do not collect personal information other than what is necessary for our operations.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Performance Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Performance cookies collect anonymous information on how visitors use our site, such as pages visited and any error messages encountered. This data helps us identify and address issues, improve site navigation, and enhance loading times. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies you personally.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Functional Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Functional cookies remember your preferences and choices, such as language settings or font sizes, making your visits more personalized and user-friendly. They improve your interaction by avoiding the need to reconfigure settings on each visit. Functional cookies do not track you across other sites.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Targeting Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Targeting cookies are used to deliver advertisements relevant to your interests and measure advertisement effectiveness. These cookies may track your browsing behavior across websites and build a profile of your interests. We work only with compliant advertising partners. You can opt-out of targeted advertising through your browser or service provider preferences.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Cookie Duration</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies on our website may be session cookies, which expire when you close your browser, or persistent cookies, which remain for a set period or until you clear them. Duration depends on the cookie’s purpose; for example, session cookies aid navigation, whereas persistent cookies remember your preferences for future visits.
    </p>

    <h2>11. How We Protect Your Data</h2>
