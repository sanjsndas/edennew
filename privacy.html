However, disabling certain cookies may limit your ability to use particular features on our website.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Protecting your personal data is a top priority. We employ advanced security technologies and procedures, including encryption and secure servers, to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of information. Our internal policies ensure staff members are trained in data protection protocols and access to personal data is restricted strictly to necessary personnel only, minimizing risks.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law. When information is no longer needed, we take appropriate steps to securely delete or anonymize it. This practice ensures that your data is not held unnecessarily, maintaining your privacy and reducing risk of data breaches.</p>

    <h2>6. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share your personal information with outside parties except for trusted service providers who assist us with essential functions such as payment processing, customer support, and website hosting. These parties are bound by confidentiality agreements and are required to protect your data according to our standards. We also cooperate with law enforcement or regulatory bodies when legally required to disclose information.</p>
